## B-AROL-O Team: The "who" and the "why"

We (the B-AROL-O Team) are a small group of friends who either currently work or have previously worked for an esteemed Italian company headquartered in [Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(wine)) - a region situated in northern Italy region.
This company has made its mark in the packaging industry, developing closure systems for wines and spirits.

On top of that, "B-AROL-O" (excluding the hyphens) is also [an iconic wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barolo) originating from Piedmont.
The renowned [Barolo wine region](https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/piedmont-wine-region/barolo/), located in close proximity to our company headquarters, entices individuals from all corners of the globe.

Reflecting on the origins of our camaraderie and embracing our sense of belonging, we decided to append a leading "B" and a trailing "O" to the company's name, thus creating a name that resonates strength and character, akin to a fine wine!

## Our projects

Once the team name is set, selecting the project name becomes as simple as picking out another exquisite grape or wine native to Piedmont üç∑ üçá ü•Ç.

**ARNEIS** (short for ``A`` utomated ``R`` ecognizer,  ``N`` etwork - ``E`` nabled, ``I`` tem ``S`` orter) is the first project developed by the B-AROL-O team.

This initiative was initiated in 2021, prompted by the [OpenCV Spatial AI Contest](https://opencv.org/opencv-spatial-ai-contest/) sponsored by [Intel&reg;](https://www.intel.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

By April 2022, [an esteemed panel of judges](https://opencv.org/blog/2022/04/15/meet-the-judges-for-opencv-spatial-ai-contest/) designated the B-AROL-O Team as a **Top 10 Finalist** from a pool of over 120 submissions.
