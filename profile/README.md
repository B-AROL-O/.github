## Who is the "B-AROL-O Team" and why

We are small group of friends who work or have worked for an Italian company with headquarters in [Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(wine)) (a northern Italy region) which developed their business around the wine industry.

"B-AROL-O" (without the hyphens) is also [a very famous wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barolo) from Piedmont - and the Barolo region (quite close to our company headquarter) is visited by people all around the workd.

To acknowledge and testify our pride in our roots, we decided to embed it the team name - we used to say "[this company](https://www.arol.com/) is in the heart of "B-AROL-O" ‚ù§Ô∏è

It looked like our love was shared!
